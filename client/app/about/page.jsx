                        Better health is central to human happiness and well-being. It also makes an important contribution to economic progress, as healthy populations live longer, are more productive, and save more. In a role as a visually challenged student, it is important that they are both physically and emotionally healthy. You can't do a good job in school, if you don't feel well. Being healthy makes you feel good and allow you to perform more effectively. You can maintain your health by taking care of yourself and avoiding toxic situations. This Project encompasses conducting periodical eye, dental and general health checkups to the visually challenged. Organizing eye surgeries based on the eye checkups and feedback from the ophthalmologists. We also organize eye checkup camps at communities and Govt. schools to prevent eye disease, early detection of eye disease will reduce the visually challenged count.

                        Studies have shown that exercise increases blood flow to the brain and helps the body build more connections between nerves, leading to increased concentration, enhanced memory, stimulated creativity, and better-developed problem solving skills. In short, playing sports helps your brain grow and makes it work better. To ensure that they get their share of entertainment we celebrate occasions like New year, Diwali, Children's' day etc. Aahlaada also helps and supports students to participate in sports, fun programs. Under this initiative, one of our students whom I&Eye supports is selected for National blind cricket team, he is representing 4th one day international blind cricket world cup happening at South Africa. Also, our student stood as the first visually challenged in INDIA officially to solve a Rubik's cube in just 48 seconds.
